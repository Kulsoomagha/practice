/* CSS stands for: Cascading style sheets 

    HTML WAS THE STRUCTURE BUT CSS ADDS STYLE TO THAT STRUCTURE

    Shortcut:
    div.container
    to make a automatic div class of container
    div#first
    to make a automatic div id of first

    we can style the page using 3 ways
    1- on the head tag calling each element (style tag)
    2- inline of the element (inline css)
    3- creating a css sheet and calling the element (external css)

    Html id and class attributes:
    when an html element is given and id it serves as a unique ientifier
    when a html element is given an class it now belongs to that class(more than one lement can belong to a same class)
    not the same case with id 
    
    p class = "cat dog fish"
    paragraph belongs to 3 diff classes now by utilizing space in between

    # is used for id
    . is used for class
    
    CSS SELECTORS:
    id 
    class
    element
    * 

    p , h1 {
    this css style will work we can add multiple like this
    }

    css priortize:
    1- inline style first (inline)
    2- style tag in head tag (internal) 
    3- css style sheet (external) 

    css is known to be working with key value pairs
    p           class = "cat dog fish"
                key         value

    margin: 0
    padding: 0
    m0+p0 use this shortcut to do the same work

    body{
    background-image: url('penguinimg.jpg');
    }

    CSS BOX MODEL
    The 4 regions of the box model are from inner to outer: 
    o Content: the actual content of the element. 
    o Padding: this is generally empty space between the content and the border. 
    o Border: This region allows for the CSS border styling. 
    o Margin: This is generally empty space between the border and the margin of the next element.

    we use box model to manipulate the content inside it according to your specifications


    display â€“ allows you to set if an element functions as a block or inline element.

    CSS FRAMEWORK:

    Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework. It is a class-based framework meaning that styling is 
    applied using HTML classes. 
    Note: because classes are highly specific, this means that overriding Bootstrap in instances where 
    you wish to apply custom styling can be difficult.
