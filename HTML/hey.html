    SDLC:
    software development lifecycle
    1= requirement = this is where we gather the requirement 
    2- analytical phase = we create budjects, timelime, conceptual requirements
    3- design phase = decisions on what tools, systems etc
    4- development= code is actually done here
    5- testing phase = various level of guys test it from the end user
    6- deployment/ mainteence = relase to client and maintain to ensure it works properly..

    waterFALL: implementation of sdlc
    its the traditional implementation of sdlc 

    it has a famous philosophy which is 
    once a step is done we can not go back to one step, we need to go through all seps again..

    that a con ..
    thats why we now normally use agile..

    AGILE:
    follows 4 principles:
    1- priortizing individuals/ clients
    2- working over comprehensive documentations
    3- customer collabrations
    4- responding to change over in every step as client please

    pros: 
    flexibile
    teamwork

    agile implements kanban and scrum:

    Scrum: 
    is a agile implementaion
    Scrum helps us divide the project time line into 2-4 weeks "sprints"

    Srum roles:
    Scrum master:
    handles scrum ceremonies: everyday standup meetings
    handles scrum team: developers and adminstrive guyss

    blockers: Blockers are issues that are encountered during development

    kanban: 
    kanban is agile implementation that uses visual board to track development
    the users story or work are demonstrated through "cards"

    scrumban:
    scrumban is a agile implemenation that combines scrum and kanban
    allowing the easy visibility of progress and assurances that duplicate efforts are not made.
